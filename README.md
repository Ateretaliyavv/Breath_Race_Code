# Breath Race - Demo Game

**Game Instructions**

- To start the game, press the Enter key.

- To cross a gap, hold down the Space key — as long as the key is held, a bridge will be built.

- To jump over an obstacle, press and hold the Up Arrow key for a sufficient duration.

Your goal is to pass all gaps and obstacles in order to win.
In the final version of the game, bridge-building and obstacle-jumping will be controlled using real breath-based techniques.
